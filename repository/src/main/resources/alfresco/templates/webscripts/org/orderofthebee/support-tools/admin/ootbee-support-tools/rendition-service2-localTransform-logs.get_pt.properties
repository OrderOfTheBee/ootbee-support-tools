transform.localTransform.logs.title=Local Transform Logs
transform.localTransform.logs.heading=Recent transformations via {0} local transform
transform.localTransform.logs.intro=This dialog shows the most recent transformations (successful / failed) as logged and reported by the local transform (T-Engine) {0} via the underlying (internal) URL {1}log. This information is retrieved as a snapshot view from any instance that currently serves that URL and may not contain all transformations, e.g. if multiple T-Engine instances are run behind a load balancing web proxy, or if the T-Engine has just been restarted.
transform.localTransform.logs.error=The logs could not be retrieved due to the following technical error: {0}
transform.localTransform.logs.noLogs=No logs could be retrieved - either the T-Engine has nothing to report (yet), does not support the relevant endpoint, or does not provide an HTML view in the expected structure.
