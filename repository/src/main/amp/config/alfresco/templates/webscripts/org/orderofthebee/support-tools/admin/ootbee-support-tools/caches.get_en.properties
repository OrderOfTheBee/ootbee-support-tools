caches.title=Caches
caches.intro=This shows all non-transactional cache instances defined in the Spring application context complying to the Alfresco SimpleCache interface. If a cache supports meaningful statistics about its usage they are included in the overview. Note that although the Enterprise Edition HazelcastSimpleCache is backed by a Hazelcast Map that technically provides statistics, these have been found to be wildly inconsistent and thus are not displayed here except for the number of read requests.
