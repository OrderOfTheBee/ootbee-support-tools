This redundant folder / web script sub-package is unfortunately required due to how the lookup for Admin Tools console web scripts works in ```console.js``` (Alfresco out-of-the-box code). This path segment is required to provide the tool group ID and by extension the grouping in the UI. It would have been great if a property of the web script descriptor could be used for that instead, but let's not dream too much...

Additionally, this folder should have had the path ```org/orderofthebee/support-tools/pages/console/support-tools``` but due to some path-evaluation hard-coding in ```console.js``` (Alfresco out-of-the-box code) we were forced to drop one layer, and both ```console``` and ```support-tools``` are required.
